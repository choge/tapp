predictor
========

A framework for prediction of TA proteins.
Mainly inplemented by Python, using some modules (libSVM, GHMM,
numpy, matplotlib, ..etc).

This framework includes a python library, predictor. This library is basically
a set of wrappers for machine-learning methods. There is also my original 
implementation of hidden Markov models, which is simply named 'hmm'.
